Simple Matrix Multiplication

1.  How many times is each element of the input matrices loaded during the execution of the kernel?



2.  What is the memory-access to floating-point computation ratio in each thread?  
    Consider a multiply and addition as separate operations, and ignore the storing 
    of the result.  Only global memory loads should be counted towards 
    your off-chip bandwidth
