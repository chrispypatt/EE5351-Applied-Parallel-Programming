QUESTION:

Consider an MxN sparse matrix with Z non-zeros and a maximum of k non-zeros per
row.
    (a) How much storage (in number of words) would a CSR representation of the 
        matrix require?
    (b) How much storage (in number of words) would a JDS representation of the 
        matrix require?


ANSWER:





QUESTION:

In the JDS format, what is the advantage of sorting rows according to the number 
of non-zero they contain?


ANSWER:





QUESTION:

In the JDS format, what is the advantage of storing the data contiguously along 
the jagged diagonal instead of along the row?
