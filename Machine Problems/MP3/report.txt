Tiled 2D Convolution

3)  Report.
    It's time to do some performance testing and analysis.  Included in the 
    MP3-convolution_block folder is a folder called "test", which contains two 
    test case input sets.  Using these test cases, and any others that you wish 
    to create to support your findings, provide answers to the following questions, 
    along with a short description of how you arrived at those answers.  

    You are free to use any timing library you like, as long as it has a reasonable 
    accuracy.  Search for the section on Timing in the CUDA C BestPractices Guide to 
    learn about how to use CUDA timing libraries. 

    Remember that kernel invocations are normally asynchronous, so if you want accurate
    timing of the kernel's running time, you need to insert a call to
    cudaDeviceSynchronize() after the kernel invocation.  

    1.  What is the measured floating-point computation rate for the CPU and GPU kernels 
    in this application?  How do they each scale with the size of the input? 
    
    Small input (32x32):
    CPU: 0.080960ms
    GPU (with overhead): 0.867200ms

    Large input (1024x1024):
    GPU (with overhead): 2.019328ms
    CPU: 81.447296ms

    2.  How much time is spent as an overhead cost of using the GPU for
    computation?  Consider all code executed within your host function, with
    the exception of the kernel itself, as overhead.  How does the overhead scale 
    with the size of the input?
    
    small input
    0.070656ms

    large input
    0.082112ms
