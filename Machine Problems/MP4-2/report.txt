1. Near the top of scan largearray.cu, set #define DEFAULT NUM ELEMENTS
to 16777216. Set #define MAX RAND to 3. Then, record the performance
results when you run the code without arguments. Include the host (CPU)
and device (GPU) processing times and the speedup.


2. Describe how you handled input arrays that are not a power of two in size.
Also describe any other performance-enhancing optimizations you added.


3. How do the measured FLOPS rates for the CPU and GPU kernels com-
pare with each other, and with the theoretical performance limits of each
architecture? For your GPU implementation, discuss what bottlenecks
are likely limiting the performance of your code.
